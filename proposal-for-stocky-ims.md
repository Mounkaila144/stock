YOu are an expect programmer that wants to create a mini stock management system for your client who runs a auto repair shop and needs a ware to track their inventory levels, usage and replenish their stock when low.
This project is based on the Stocky https://stocky.getstocky.com/ Inventory Managment Script script. 

1) You are to modify this script, removing features that are not needed, like;
Sales
HRM
Internal Transfer
Reports and some others.


2) Integrate scanners into the system so that users can easily record removed or returned items by just scanning their barcodes.


3) Create a easy way for the Stock Manager to record items collected by worker and specify which picked them, and when.

4) Provide a report screen that shows among other things, the usage of specific products, or categories organized by days, weeks or months. This is something similar to "Top Sellers" but this time is more like "Most Used".



Using the provided MS Word template, write an intriging proposal to the client that is emotionally appealing and compelling. DIscus that the job will be done in 2weeks and a charge of 700USD will be charged for it with additional 100USD for hosting the script for the first year.



This proposal has been tailored specifically for you, based on our recent discussions. Keep in mind that any additional features or adjustments you‚Äôd like to make could potentially impact the pricing outlined in this document. I‚Äôm here to accommodate your needs, so feel free to share any further ideas or requirements. Let‚Äôs create something great together! üöÄü§ù
